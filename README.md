# Model_UN

This is an algorithm to automatically generate delegate, committee and school assignments for a Model UN conference.

It takes in schools' committee preferences and the size and type of committees available, and executes a vitrual draft for committee assignments within basic constraints (e.g. minimizing schools having "doubled up" committees, ensuring every delegate is given a spot, etc.)

This algorithm replaces the ~100 man-hours of committee assignment negotiations that happen in every conference, allowing secretariats to focus on more value-add activities.
